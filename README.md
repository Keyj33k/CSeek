## cseekers Mission
- scan address range in local network to detect reachable devices<br>
- optional port scanning config for live hosts and determining of services behind open ports<br>
- store succeed results to a file for saving a detailed summary<br>

## :rocket: Getting Started: 

1 ) Make sure, you have `python` installed:
```
python3 --version
```
2 ) If it isn't installed (Debian/-based):
```
sudo apt-get install python3
```
3 ) Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Keyj33k/cseek-ClientIdentifier-Python.git
```
4 ) `Run cseek` using the following command:
```
python3 cseek.py -h
```

## Options/Usage

```
usage: cseek.py [-h] [-u] -a address -b begin_host -f final_host [-s start_port] [-l last_port] [-c ping_count]
example: cseek.py -a 192.168.2 -b 1 -f 100 -c 1 --unlock -s 10 -l 90 

cseek - Network Client Identifier

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u, --unlock          unlock port scanning
  -a address, --addr address
                        address to ping (first three octets only)
  -b begin_host, --begin begin_host
                        host where the scan should start
  -f final_host, --final final_host
                        host where the scan should end
  -s start_port, --start start_port
                        port where the scan should start
  -l last_port, --last last_port
                        port where the scan should end
  -c ping_count, --count ping_count
                        determine ping count

```

## My Motivation
In most cases I used a simple bash script to start the recon session to learn about the network of the <br> 
current pentest. It's a really good method to getting started, but for bigger ranges it's nearly <br> 
impossible to keep the overview. If the Bash script located active devices, I had to do a port scan on <br> 
each hosts separately. While this process, the workspace looked very messy and the overview was lost quickly. <br> 
In a nutshell, I wanted to create a tool that would do all these things itself and simply save all active <br> 
devices and their associated open ports to one file. If cseek stored the results, I know where i need to begin <br>
my next steps without loosing much time and keep a clear workspace too.
